### Introduction and Naming Pattern

Each token is named with the prefix `typography/heading-size-` followed by the HTML heading level (`h1` through `h6`). The value stored in every token is a CSS `clamp()` expression: the first number is the minimum size in **rem**, the middle term combines a base size with a **vw** multiplier for fluid scaling, and the final number is the maximum size the text will reach on very large screens.

For example, `typography/heading-size-h1` is set to
`clamp(3.18rem, 2.606rem + 2.87vw, 5.19rem)`,
which means an **H1** will never shrink below 3.18 rem, will grow proportionally as the viewport widens, and will stop growing once it hits 5.19 rem.

#### Practical Guidelines

- **Use the tokens, not hard-coded values.** Dropping `var(--typography-heading-size-h2)` into a class keeps every page consistent and lets you update all H2 sizes from one place.
- **Accessibility first.** Because the sizes are defined in `rem`, users who enlarge their base font size for readability will see headings scale up automatically.
- **Fluid but predictable.** Designers get smooth scaling between breakpoints without custom media queries, and clients with basic CSS knowledge can still read and tweak the values if needed.
- **Extend if required.** If your project needs additional text styles (e.g., `body-large`, `caption`), follow the same patternâ€”prefix with `typography/`, use plain words, and store a `clamp()` value.

By keeping the naming scheme consistent and the values self-explanatory, even novice editors can adjust typography confidently, while advanced builders gain the precision and flexibility they need for more complex layouts.

#### How to use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Variables Tab">
    Create a new Webflow variable under the Variables Tab (V)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create All Variables">
    Copy and paste each heading-size variable below, with the clamp() function as all their variables. The `typography/` prefix will group all of the typography variables together.

    ```css
    typography/heading-size-h1: clamp(3.18rem, 2.606rem + 2.87vw, 5.19rem)
    typography/heading-size-h2: clamp(2.52rem, 2.174rem + 1.73vw, 3.4013rem)
    typography/heading-size-h3: clamp(2rem, 1.802rem + 0.99vw, 2.5019rem)
    typography/heading-size-h4: clamp(1.59rem, 1.492rem + 0.49vw, 1.8369rem)
    typography/heading-size-h5: clamp(1.26rem, 1.222rem + 0.19vw, 1.3539rem)
    typography/heading-size-h6: clamp(1rem, 1rem + 0vw, 1rem)
    
    
    typography/line-height-ratio: 1.618
    /* 
    	Ratio is used to calculate the line height: 
    	calc(font-size * line-height-ratio)
    */
    ```

    ```css
    typography/text-size-large: clamp(1.14rem, 1.106rem + 0.17vw, 1.2277rem)
    typography/text-size-regular: clamp(1rem, 0.986rem + 0.07vw, 1.0367rem)
    typography/text-size-small: clamp(0.875rem, 0.875rem + 0vw, 0.875rem)
    ```
