Add every brand colour to the Design Token collection using either a HEX or RGB value, and label each variable with the simple prefix `color-`, followed by a plain-language hue such as `red` (for example, `color-red-brand`). Avoid descriptive names like “crimson” so non-designers can recognise the palette at a glance. For the primary brand colour, also create one lighter tint and one darker shade, named `color-red-light` and `color-red-dark`. This straightforward, predictable pattern makes it easy for anyone—designer or client—to locate and update colours without guesswork.

1. **Add every brand color as a Design Token.**
   - Use either HEX ( `#FF5733` ) or RGB ( `255 87 51` ) values—whichever your team prefers.
2. **Keep names plain-language.**
   - Choose everyday words like `red` instead of designer terms such as `crimson`.
3. **Apply a consistent prefix.**
   - Start each variable with `color-`, for example: `color-red-brand`.
4. **Include one tint and one shade of the primary brand color.**
   - **Tint (lighter):** `color-red-light`
   - **Shade (darker):** `color-red-dark`

The tint and/or shade are mostly used for different states, such as <Tooltip tip="Change the color when a user hovers over an element.">Hover</Tooltip>, <Tooltip tip="Change the color when a user focuses on an element.">Focus</Tooltip> and Active.

### Add to Webflow

Inside of the Design Tokens Variable collection, replace the COLOR_NAME text and add the following variables:

```json
{
	"colors/color-{COLOR_NAME}-brand": "#ea0029",
	"colors/color-{COLOR_NAME}-light": "#ff264c",
	"colors/color-{COLOR_NAME}-dark": "#900c23"
}
```

e.g. `color-red-brand` (default),  `color-red-light` , `color-red-dark`

### Neutral

Used mainly for default background and text colors. Neurtal colors typically range from white to black.

```json
{
	"colors/color-neutral-light": "#ffffff",
	"colors/color-neutral-dark": "#000000",
}
```
