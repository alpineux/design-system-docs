Design tokens are the foundational variables that define key visual elements such as colors, font sizes, spacing values, and other style-related properties. These tokens ensure visual consistency across your entire website. The "Design Tokens" collection acts as the primary reference, meaning all other variable collections will rely on this as their single source of truth.
